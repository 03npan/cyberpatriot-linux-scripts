# cyberpatriot-linux-scripts
As I am no longer competing in CyberPatriot, I will not be updating the script and checklist anymore. They will remain here purely as reference material.

A fancier version of my script is being developed [here](https://github.com/Shri3kinband1t/linuxlockdown/blob/main/Ubuntu-locker.sh) in collaboration with Curtis Arnold.
