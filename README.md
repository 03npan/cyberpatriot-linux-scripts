# cyberpatriot-linux-scripts
The script I used for securing Linux systems in CyberPatriot (primarily Ubuntu 14/16/18, but some of it may work on Debian/other Ubuntu versions as well). While the script covers a good portion of the basics, it won't fix the more difficult/obscure vulnerabilities in the images.

As I am no longer competing in CyberPatriot, I will not be updating the script anymore. It will remain here purely as reference material. I may also upload my checklist in the future as well.

A [fancier version](https://github.com/Shri3kinband1t/linuxlockdown/blob/main/Ubuntu-locker.sh) of my script was previously under development in collaboration with Curtis Arnold - however, it is out-of-date and he is not working on the project anymore.
