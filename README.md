# cyberpatriot-linux-scripts
As I am no longer competing in CyberPatriot, I will not be updating the script and checklist anymore. They will remain here purely as reference material.

A [fancier version](https://github.com/Shri3kinband1t/linuxlockdown/blob/main/Ubuntu-locker.sh) of my script was previously under development in collaboration with Curtis Arnold - however, it is out-of-date and he is not working on the project anymore.
