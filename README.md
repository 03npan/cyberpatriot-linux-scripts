# cyberpatriot-linux-scripts
Placeholder repository for my CyberPatriot Linux scripts. Per competition rules, I will not be adding the scripts here (no sharing of scripts) until after the 2020-2021 season ends. I will also upload my checklist here. Afterwards, I will no longer maintain the script and checklist. They will remain here purely as reference material.

A fancier version of my script is being developed [here](https://github.com/Shri3kinband1t/linuxlockdown/blob/main/Ubuntu-locker.sh) in collaboration with Curtis Arnold.
